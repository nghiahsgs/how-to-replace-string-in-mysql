Why watch YouTube TV on a laptop?

The great thing about YouTube TV is that you can connect your phone to it and stream videos through it.

First, you need to fake the user agent of your browser. Open up the dev tools, then go to More Tools > Network Conditions > paste the TV user agent into it:

```
Mozilla/5.0(SMART-TV; Linux; Tizen 4.0.0.2) AppleWebkit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) SamsungBrowser/9.2 TV Safari/605.1.15
```
Next, navigate to the link and enjoy:
```
https://www.youtube.com/tv#/
```
Tip: To connect with your phone, go to the settings of YouTube TV and select "connect to the same Wi-Fi."
