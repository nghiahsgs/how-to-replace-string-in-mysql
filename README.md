To replace a string in MySQL, you can use the REPLACE function. The syntax is as follows:

```
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = REPLACE(column_name, 'string_to_replace', 'replacement_string');
```
In the above query, table_name is the name of the table that you want to update, column_name is the name of the column that you want to replace the string in, string_to_replace is the string that you want to replace, and replacement_string is the string that you want to replace it with.

Here's an example query that replaces all occurrences of the string 'foo' with the string 'bar' in the column my_column of the my_table table:

```
UPDATE my_table SET my_column = REPLACE(my_column, 'foo', 'bar');
```
Note that this query will update all rows in the table that contain the specified string. If you want to update only certain rows, you can add a WHERE clause to the query.
